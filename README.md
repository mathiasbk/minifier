# Minifier
Simple minifier to minify a single HTML file that contains html, css and JS

## How to use
It's a console app that takes filepaths to .html files as arguments.
If no arguments it provided it minimizes all the .html files in the same folder as the program.

Just run it with:
```
minimizer.exe Index.html
```

Or to minimize all html files in the same folder:
```
minimizer.exe
```
